Different classes occur regularly throughout the day at Spas, Gyms, and sometimes Parks. When one is about to start, your Sim will receive a notification from the Yoga Instructor. You can click on the Instructor’s portrait to find out where they are and join the class.\n\nIf your local Spa, Gym, or Park staff isn’t enough, you can select an Instructor's Yoga Mat and Request an additional Yoga Instructor. You can also Hire a Yoga Instructor at home."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x9CBE5DD9<!--String: "Tired of following someone else’s lead? Then it’s time to teach your own class! Sims can click the Instructor's Yoga Mat and choose to Lead other Sims in a Routine or Teach a class for some cash. Where public classes are open to everyone, private classes are invite-only. Once a session starts, click on other Sims and invite them to join.\n\nHousehold members are welcome to join any class, but remember, you won’t earn money from within your own household."--></T>

Only mats near the Instructor's Yoga Mat will be included in class, but there’s no need to worry if you forget to bring spares! Sims will rent and place a mat to use during class if no mats are available."--></T>
