Progress for Skills can be tracked in two places. \n\nThe first place is in the game window. While actively gaining a skill, a Progress Bar will display above a Sim's head with the Skill icon. This bar indicates how close a Sim is to gaining a new level, and once the bar has completely filled a new Level in that Skill will be gained."--></T>

This can be accessed by clicking on the Lightbulb Icon or pressing the [L] shortcut. Progress across all Skills is easily visible in this panel, and the right column indicates current Skill Level.
