      <T n="text">0xDF3B52EE<!--String: "Sims will autonomously want to check on and care for Infants, especially when an Infant is fussing or crying. Frequency and quality of care is impacted by a Caregiver's Traits, Ages, and Relationship with the Infant.\n\nSims who do not share a relationship with the infant won't care about them as much. Not all Sims start out as Caregivers. If a Sim in the household would like to become a Caregiver for the Infant they can click on the Infant and choose to Adopt as Care Dependent."--></T>

Each Infant will have a preference for each type of food. They can either Like, Love, Dislike, or be Unsure about a particular food."--></T>
