Use the Move option to pick up and move your Pool. Use the Rotate buttons to rotate the Pool left and right.\n\nProtip: Rotating can be destructive! Pick up your Pool with the Move option and then use the keyboard shortcut [&lt;] and [&gt;] to safely rotate."--></T>

You cannot use manipulator to drag terrain Pools into Rooms or structures on another level-this would be super destructive. You are also unable to remove and build Pools walls via context menu. The water would just flood the space!\n\nProtip: You can drag a Pool into a Room if you first remove the room’s wall."--></T>

This allows you to easily move and manipulate your Pools, and customize the look you are seeking.\n\nNote: Pools and Rooms will not merge since they are different block types. "--></T>
