Advancing in each of the Fundamental Skills unlocks new ways for Children to interact with the world around them. \n\nChildren may also start developing certain "adult" Skills that are available for Teens and older. However, because they are children, they gain these skills at a slower rate. Like Fundamental Skills, these basic Skills may unlock new ways for Children to interact with the world, but some interactions will require them to age up to Teen before they become available.
