It will be up to you to decide whether or not your Sim will follow their Wants.\n\nSims can have 3 different Wants at once, though one of them will be more about what the Sim wants at the moment."--></T>

Allowing the Sim to do what they want will have them feeling fulfilled and happier with life!\n\nSatisfaction points are granted on completing the Wants of your Sims. This can then be used in the reward store for some awesome rewards.\n\nSome Sims might not appreciate having their Wants ignored for a long time."--></T>

If you really want to see your Sim succeed at completing their Want, you can pin the Wants so they won't get reset.\n\nYou can also go to the Rewards store and spend some of those Satisfaction points you earned to buy the "Want Refresher" potion to reset your Sim's Wants whenever you want!"--></T>
