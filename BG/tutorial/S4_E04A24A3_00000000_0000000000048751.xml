      <T n="text">0xB929DE62<!--String: "With Wants making a comeback, so are Fears: \n\nFears are traits that your Sim may obtain through gameplay. Sound a bit vague? \n\nHere is an example of a possible Fear that your Sim may get! Let's just say for some reason your Sim caught on fire and survived. Well, that can be quite terrifying and your Sim will most likely gain a Fear of fire.\n\nThere are numerous ways of getting a Fear on your sim and each one will have an interesting effect on how your Sim behaves in the world. Be careful! Sims are not limited to just one Fear at a time."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x44B4F046<!--String: "What are the consequences of having a Fear trait on your Sim? Well, it will depend on what Fear your Sim gets. Fears will come with permanent negative effects until your Sim is ready to overcome them. The effects will vary and are not limited to: negative moodlets appearing, higher chances of failing interactions, and some changes to their behavior in certain situations.\n\nThat sounds awful! Don't worry, Fears are meant to be overcome! It may take some time and hard work, but you can help your Sim overcome their Fear when the time is right!"--></T>

Helping your Sim complete this confrontation goal will help them overcome their Fear. Some Fears may take multiple confrontations in order to be fully removed.\n\nWhen your Sim overcomes their Fear they will become proud of what they did and the Fear will be removed from their traits! \n\nYou can also purchase a "Fear-Be-Gone" potion from the Reward Store to quickly remove a Fear that your Sim has gained."--></T>
