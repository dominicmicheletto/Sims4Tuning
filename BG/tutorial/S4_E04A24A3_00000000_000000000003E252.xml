      <T n="text">0xD06BD191<!--String: "Sentiments are how a Sim feels about another Sim based on recent past experiences. There are Positive and Negative Sentiments, which can influence a Sim’s Mood and behavior when the other Sim is around! These are discovered naturally through gameplay and will fade over time. The amount of time it takes for a Sentiment to fade depends on if it is a Long-Term or Short-Term Sentiment. \n\nNew experiences together can also make existing Sentiments fade more quickly or more slowly. Positive Sentiments are easily eroded by very negative experiences, and a successful apology goes a long way towards healing any Negative Sentiments. The colored backdrop behind a Sentiment icon indicates how far it is along in the fading process.\n\nA Sim may have up to four Sentiments about another Sim at a time. If a Sim acquires more than four Sentiments about a particular Sim, the least important Sentiment will be replaced."--></T>
