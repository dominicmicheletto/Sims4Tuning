If you’re looking for something more intimate, a dinner party is the perfect choice—as long as you can cook a meal without burning down your new house!\n\nPreparations aren't necessary but a little goes a long way! You could play some nice music, clean the dishes, and freshen up. Is your home missing anything? Perhaps a bar to serve drinks, or a proper dining table? Buy it! Some nice decor doesn’t hurt, either!\n\nWhenever you’re ready, just pick up your phone and invite people over. At this point, you can also hire caterers, bartenders, and more—if your wallet allows it!\n\nDon’t worry, you’ve got this! Can’t wait, see you soon!"--></T>
