You’re lucky I called!\n\nIf you believe a good joke is the way to a Sim’s heart, focus your efforts on the Comedy skill. Everyone loves an entertainer!\n\nMischief is a precarious social skill; some Sims love being pranked, while others despise it. But if you master the art of mischief, you’ll be able to bring a smile to the most dour of Sims.\n\nThe most important social Skill, in my opinion, is Charisma. Not only will you develop new relationships faster, but all of your social interactions will also become more powerful and likely to succeed! If you want to become a great comedian or prankster, it pays off to improve your Charisma, too."--></T>
