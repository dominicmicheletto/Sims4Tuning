      <T n="text">0x468A880E<!--String: "Before using the Water Tool to add a pond, lake, tributary, or any other naturally occurring water feature to your lot, you're going to need a hole to put all that water in. Visit the Terrain Manipulation lesson if you need additional information on how to dig a hole into your lot's terrain."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x5CDDA72F<!--String: "With an empty hole dug into your lot, open the Terrain Tools section in Build Mode, then select the Water Tool category. Here, you'll find four buttons: Raise Water, Lower Water, Fill to Height, and Remove Water.\n\nTo turn a hole into a pond, you'll always start with the Raise Water button. With this button selected, the location you click within a hole is where the water line will fill to. If you click and hold, the water will incrementally continue to fill the hole until the water reaches the top."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x83675BED<!--String: "If you want to reduce the amount of water that's filling a hole, use the Lower Water button. With this button selected, you can click on any water surface created by the Water Tool, and you will lower the water a small amount. You may also click and hold to continue lowering the water line until it reaches the desired depth within the hole."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xA06043EB<!--String: "The Fill to Height button allows you to select a specific height that you want the water line to be set at. This can be useful when you want the water line to be at the same height across multiple separate ponds.\n\nWith the Fill to Height button selected, you will see a white square adjacent to your cursor, which indicates the height at which water will fill to when clicked. A tooltip will also automatically appear that explains how to raise and lower the height of the white square, so that you can specify the precise height at which you want the water line set to."--></T>

Any objects that were floating on the surface of the water will automatically be moved to your household's inventory when the water is removed."--></T>

In addition to placing decorative objects, you can select a Water Style to change the appearance of the water itself. In the Pond Effects category, you'll find cards you can place on the surface of a pond, which will attract designated wildlife or other effects to their location while in Live Mode."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x93C15F6C<!--String: "Having areas of shallow water along the edge of a pond is essential if you want Sims to interact with the pond. In addition, some objects (<i>for example - Water Emitters</i>) are only allowed to be placed in shallow water within ponds. To help with this, you can enable the Water Depth Map, which is a checkbox located within the Water Tool. This visualization will show the shallow areas of your pond in bright green, and will fade to blue in deeper water.\n\nYou can also use the Terrain Manipulation tools while the Water Depth Map is turned on, allowing you see how shallow or deep a pond is as you adjust the terrain underneath it. You can press the "P" key to toggle the Water Depth Map on and off in either of these two Build tools."--></T>

Ponds can be stocked with any discovered fish in your Household Collections.
