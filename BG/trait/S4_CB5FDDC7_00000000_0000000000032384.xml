  <T n="trait_description">0x227EB463<!--String: "<b>Trade: Freelance Artist</b>\n\nCan a digital painting make you cry? Right now, no one knows. This is partly because many would consider the very idea frivolous. But it's also because whoever successfully answers this question must first have answered several others.\n\nWhy do we cry? Why do we laugh, or love, or smile? What are the touchstones of our emotions?\n\nUntil now, the people who asked such questions tended not to be the same people who created digital art. Instead, they were writers, filmmakers, painters, musicians. They were, in the traditional sense, artists.\n\nWe're about to change that tradition. The name of our agency is Electrified Artists."--></T>
