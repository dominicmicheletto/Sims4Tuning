To help with repopulation, fishing needs to be banned from 12PM to 8PM. Only morning or night fishing allowed! Of course, professional fishermen are exempt during work hours, and approved local events may continue. No need to start a riot.\n\nConsult on this policy to regulate fishing hours and give fish populations the chance to grow. There definitely won't be troublemakers and rebels to deal with. Definitely not."--></T>
