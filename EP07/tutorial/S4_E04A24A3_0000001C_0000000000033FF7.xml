      <T n="text">0xE4ABCC38<!--String: "As Sims enter the ocean, they’ll be in wading depth water, where they can walk and socialize. Once your Sim is in deep water, the real fun begins. This is where you can use boats, float loungers, or maybe have something icky brush your leg!"--></T>

      <T n="text">0x1013F53C<!--String: "Keep an eye out for Buoys floating in the ocean. There are two types of buoys: Snorkel Buoys and Diving Buoys. Click on Buoys in clear water, surrounded by fish and coral to snorkel. Click on Buoys in deeper water to scuba dive for treasure and seashells, or take underwater photos. Sometimes, you might catch dolphins playing around these buoys. If you see dolphins, select the school of fish near the buoy to see if you can call them over."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x9673B348<!--String: "Boats open up how a Sim moves through the world and can offer different activities around the ocean. Aqua-Zips or Canoes can be used when in a Sim’s Inventory. Boats, as well as other objects used in the ocean, can be purchased from kiosks in the world. You can also use open water Docking Points and Ladders for easy access to ocean activities. When you’re done riding around on the Aqua-Zip or Outrigger Canoe click on the docking point to return your vehicle to shore."--></T>
