These lots are managed by the universities so there are some restrictions when building these lots.\n\nNo ovens or open fire cooking objects will be permitted in University Housing. Additionally once a Sim lives on a University Housing lot there will be no way to make major adjustments to the lot. The only things you'll be able to change are decorations and objects that can be moved in Live mode."--></T>
