The team decided to work on developing an augmented reality face filter for Sims to try on their phones. There was not anything like it and the team was jazzed about creating it. The hackathon was short in time but the team was strong together, so they had practiced code beforehand and just needed {0.SimFirstName} to replicate it with the computer vision recognition for the face detection. When it came time to present the app outcome, the Copperdale computer team was able to pull off the cutest face filter! The judge even tried it themselves, showing off the freezer bunny face filter that even blinked when you did! The cuteness won over the judging panel, making {0.SimFirstName}'s tech the winner!
