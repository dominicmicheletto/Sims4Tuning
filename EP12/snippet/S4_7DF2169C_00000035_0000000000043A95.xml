The team decided to work on developing a freezer bunny augmented reality face filter for sims to try on their phones. It was a highly ambitious idea, given the short timeframe they had to complete the project. Each team member had worked on a piece of this application during practice but they did not cohesively put together a final product . As time began to run out, it was up to {0.SimFirstName} to complete the project with adding the correct art asset to the face detection tracker. As {M0.he}{F0.she} was finishing up the code, the judges called for all coding to STOP. Now it was time for the judge to try the tech...It did trigger the activation but it was definitely not the freezer bunny art asset....the judges head was turned into a giant poop swirl with a talking mouth. How embarrassing! Copperdale did not win the hackathon.  "--></T>
