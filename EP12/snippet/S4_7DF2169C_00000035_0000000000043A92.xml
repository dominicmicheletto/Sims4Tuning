The squad had been practicing for this moment but {0.SimFirstName} may have missed a few practice sessions. Still, the star move was easy enough to do alone... Clapping from the audience was their signal to enter the stage for the routine. The light went dark for a dramatic effect and the spotlight illuminated {0.SimFirstName} as {M0.he}{F0.she} stood in the front and center of the cheer group. Startled by the timing of the light, {0.SimFirstName} threw the pom poms up in the air, smacking one of the cheer members in the face. Ouch, what were they doing there? The music started and {0.SimFirstName} made the big move - a backflip that was supposed to be a twirl in the air and then getting caught by the squad... but maybe it was too early because nobody caught {M0.him}{F0.her}. {0.SimFirstName} fell down hard but the embarrassment was even worse.
