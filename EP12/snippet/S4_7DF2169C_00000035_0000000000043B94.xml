Has {0.SimFirstName} practiced well enough to pull it off? {0.SimFirstName} gave it a try by using the countermove to beat the opponent with their own tactic. The opponent caught on quite quickly and blocked the countermovement. Oh, {0.SimFirstName} was so close! With more practice, {M0.he}{F0.she} might have been able to pull it off. "--></T>
