The squad has been practicing hard for this and now is the moment to shine in front of the judges. Clapping from the audience was their signal to enter the stage for the routine. The lights went dark for a dramatic effect and the spotlight illuminated {0.SimFirstName} as {M0.he}{F0.she} stood in the front and center of the cheer group. The music of their routine started and {0.SimFirstName} threw {M0.his}{F0.her} pom poms up in the air before doing a back flip into the arms of the squad. The catch was just right and the team pulled off a exuberant routine that ended in a standing ovation. It was just obvious that Copperdale won first place! "--></T>
