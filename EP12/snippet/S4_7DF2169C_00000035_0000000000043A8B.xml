The opposing team is really putting in an effort tonight and the game is tied. After successfully moving the ball in the 4th quarter, Copperdale is lined up for a game winning drive. {0.SimFirstName} who was paying attention in practice, realizes that the coach has called their featured play where they line up at Tight End. The play goes just as planned. The opposing team falls for the play fake and {0.SimFirstName} is wide open. The quarterback throws an accurate pass and {0.SimFirstName} catches the football successfully. {0.SimFirstName} notices a rare opportunity in the open field and a chance to score the game winning touchdown.\n{0.SimFirstName} ran as fast as {M0.he}{F0.she} possibly could. The end zone came into sight and {0.SimFirstName} began to hear the cheers roar across the field. Touchdown! The Copperdale football team wins the night!"--></T>
