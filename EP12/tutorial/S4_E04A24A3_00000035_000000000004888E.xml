Teens will start to grow body hair throughout their teenhood, and there are ways that your teen can manage it as they prefer. This can be customized through Create a Sim. While in Create a Sim, select the Body category; there will now be options for you to choose from in terms of body hair. Selecting a thumbnail in Create a Sim will select a preferred length where your Sim can choose to shave down to the preferable length of hair. You can choose fun colors, or you can choose to turn growth off by selecting the growth button in Create a Sim. Facial hair will also grow to the preferred length and work the same way body hair does. "--></T>
