You can then engage in hyping out and promoting the outfit that you created to other Sims around the world! Hype will increase the value of your outfit when you decide to sell it using Trendi. The style trend of your Fashion Look will also increase which will change up the outfits worn by Sims in the world."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x9E71FEA3<!--String: "Sick of the outfit you made? Used it too many times? You can sell Fashion Looks that you have made any time you want! You can do this by opening the Sims inventory, selecting the outfit, and choosing the "Sell outfit on Trendi" interaction. You can also sell it via the phone by opening the Trendi App and selecting the List a Look functionality on the app! You can then try to sell the outfit at whatever price you feel it deserves! Careful, though! If you set the price too high, you might get fewer buyers! Remember, the higher the hype, the more demand for the outfit; the higher the price you can sell it!"--></T>
