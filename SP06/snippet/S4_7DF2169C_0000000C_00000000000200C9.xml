Just moments ago I noticed your grades suddenly jump upwards in the school's database, and I'm forced to conclude that you hacked into our system. Perhaps you have a future as a Tech Guru, but such behavior is not to be rewarded as long as you remain in my institution of education. I've been forced to not only return your grade to it's previous level, but I've dropped you one letter grade further as a punitive action. Think of positive ways to channel your knowledge in the future instead of taking embarrassing shortcuts to get ahead."--></T>
