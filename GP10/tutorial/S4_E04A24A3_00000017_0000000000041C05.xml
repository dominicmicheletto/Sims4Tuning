Listen for a subtle little audio cue to confirm when items have been successfully slotted or un-slotted.\n\nMove the entire group by clicking and dragging the parent object. Whatever piece in the family you hover over, the parent will always have a gentle pulse highlight to keep you grounded."--></T>
