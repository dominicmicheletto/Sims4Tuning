      <T n="text">0xA530E89F<!--String: "Sims can raise their Parenting Skill by researching on the computer or by reading skill books. The best way to improve is actual parenting. In fact, the only way to reach the top levels of Parenting Skill is by practicing parenting skills. Work with children to encourage good behavior and discourage poor behavior. A caregiver solving a child's needs using the parenting socials will learn from that experience."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x953D7D12<!--String: "As a parent, a Sim will also feel the need to guide children through their daily routines. Parents can take a soft approach and try to influence their children to do things like clean dishes or go to bed. Some more stubborn children will need a more direct approach. Parents can give the child no option and force them to do their chores."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xC5BD11EB<!--String: "A parent's job isn't just about directing a child's behavior. Skilled parents will also help their children out by quickly solving their needs. The caregiver can influence the child to get a quick snack to hold off hunger. Other times they can tell the child to dust themselves off to quickly clean up."--></T>

A great parent will pick up on non-verbal cues and can determine what the newborn needs. Knowing when a newborn is hungry vs. sleepy could save many needless hours of crying."--></T>
