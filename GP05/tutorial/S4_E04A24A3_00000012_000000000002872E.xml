      <T n="text">0xCE632F97<!--String: "Children often need a firm parent to help shape them into model citizens. They need to be taught that making a mess isn't acceptable. Parents can encourage or discourage their positive and negative behavior.\n\nDiscouragement comes in a variety of severities. Parents could gently ask a child not to do something, give the child a firm talking to, or lose it and yell at the child to stop."--></T>

Sometimes they will listen willingly, sometimes they will listen unwillingly, and sometimes they will outright reject the disciplinary action."--></T>

All groundings last for one day. Responsible children wouldn't dare break a grounding rule. Less responsible children may try to get away with a lot more. A child caught breaking grounding rules can be grounded again."--></T>
