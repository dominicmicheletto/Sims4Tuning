There are 5 Character Values that can be positive or negative: Manners, Responsibility, Conflict Resolution, Empathy, and Emotional Control. Toddlers, Children, and Teens can gain or lose values based on their actions and how their parents participate in these behaviors.\n\nOnce a Sim ages up to a Young Adult, their Character Values are locked in, and they will receive a unique Trait depending where their Character Values lie."--></T>

Each of the 5 values can be viewed here.\n\nOnce a value has reached the dark ends of the meter, the Sim is in range to receive a Trait when they age up. The Sim can still fall out of range until they age up to a young adult.\n\nHover over each Character Value to view ways you can influence the value."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x5E064C5A<!--String: "Depending on the traits the Sim starts with, they may have some Character Values to begin with. For example, a Sim with the Slob trait will start with a little bit of negative Manners. But Sims can still change their Manners values through their actions, such as cleaning up dishes. They won't be stuck in the negative as long as their actions speak louder than their heart!"--></T>

      <T n="text">0x8EF0EE35<!--String: "When a Teen ages up to Young Adult their Character Values progress will be converted into traits. These traits will impact the Sim's day-to-day life. For example, a Sim that gets the Responsible Trait will do better at their job, working hard without the stress, and automatically complete their Daily Task. It pays to have a good foundation!"--></T>
