But let's see... The main things you'll want to check out are the festivals and the different districts.\n\nYou'll find the Flea Market and Spice Festival in the Spice Market. Then you have the Arts Quarter, which is home to the Humor and Hijinks Festival. The Fashion district is where you'll find GeekCon and the Romance Festival. And last but not least, Uptown, the heart of the city. Nothing but expansive skyrises and the city's rich and powerful."--></T>
