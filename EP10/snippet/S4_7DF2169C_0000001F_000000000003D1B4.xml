If you're looking for something more ordinary... Meet locals at a pub. Visit Lykke Centre. There's always something to do there. \n\nHowever, if you're looking for something more adventurous or historical... Head on over to the Crumbling Isle. It's gorgeous, but what you'll really want to see are the bluffs. You could also visit the Old Platz ruins in the most historic part of town. \n\nThen again, if you're feeling particularly brave, visit Windslar and see the Von Haunt Estate. There's a mansion and garden maze, but everyone knows it's haunted. "--></T>
