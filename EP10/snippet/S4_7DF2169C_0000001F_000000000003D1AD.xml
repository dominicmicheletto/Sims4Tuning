Then again, there's also a lot of adventure to be had!\n\nYou could head over to Mua Pel'am and check out the active volcano. Just don't fall in! There's also a waterfall, a cave, and an old shipwreck site. Lani St.Taz has white sand beaches. It's a little more high end. \n\nBut the heart of Sulani is in Ohan'ali Town. It used to be a small fishing village, but now it's the cultural hub of the island. Check around, because there's sure to be some festivals happening. "--></T>
