Of course, you see a lot of celebrities around. <i>Any</i> tourist has to visit Starlight Boulevard to check out the celebrity tiles. Lights! Glamour! Adventure in the city! \n\nBut let me tell you, nowhere beats the views you get looking out over the Pinnacles at night. Mostly the celebrities live there, but you can always stop by to take pictures. \n\nMost people live in Mirage Park though, just outside of downtown. It can be kind of noisy and cramped, but it's a fun area. It feels more 'real' than the rest of the valley."--></T>
