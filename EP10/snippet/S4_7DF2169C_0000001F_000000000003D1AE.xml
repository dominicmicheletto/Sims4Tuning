Foxbury Institute is the newer of the pair. It's probably about fifty years old now? The University of Britechester, on the other hand, has been around a very long time. Supposedly, it's even haunted. They both bring in a lot of students to the area. \n\nNestled between the two universities you have the oldest part of town, Gibbs Hill. This is where most of the locals live. The canal runs through it, and almost every building is historical. There's also the ruins... People in town have been whispering about strange nocturnal meetings happening over there. It might be safest to steer clear of that place at night. "--></T>
