Komorebi is the perfect place to relax or get your blood pumping. \n\nFirst, you'll want to visit Wakaba, young leaves, at the base of the mountain. Try the vendor stalls, pick up information on the mountain, and maybe you'll catch the Festival of Youth. You can't leave before meeting our town mascot!\n\nHalfway up is historical Senbamachi, our town of a thousand leaves. I'd recommend a hike through the bamboo forest or fishing. When the Festival of Light is being held, you'll find it there. \n\nAt the peak is Yukimatsu, named for the snow covered pines in the area. That's where you can hit the slopes or go rock climbing, then visit the bathhouse to relax. It's also home of the world famous Snow Festival."--></T>
