I dare not reveal all the realm's secrets, but there are a few notes of interest that might help you along your patch.\n\nSeek out any of the three Sages within the Magic Headquarters to begin a magical journey. It is the balance of the three houses which keeps our realm together, otherwise we'd be torn apart by the vortex. On the outskirts of the main platform are various portals that you can explore. One portal leads to Casters Alley, which is a magical marketplace. Another to the dueling grounds, while the third leads to our gardens. That is all I will say."--></T>
