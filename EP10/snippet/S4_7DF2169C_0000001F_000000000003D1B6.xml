For starters, you have that military compound on the edge of town next to the crater, filled with a secret lab. Need I say more? Security is pretty tight around there, but I hear some kids were able to get in through a crack in the back of the fence. \n\nThe locals are a little weird too. But if you really want to meet them, head down to the StrangerVille Plaza. There's even a little curio shop where you could pick up a souvenir or two from your visit."--></T>
