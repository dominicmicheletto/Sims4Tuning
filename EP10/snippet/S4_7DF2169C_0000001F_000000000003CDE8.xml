Simply find a Hiking Info Board and select the destination you wish to hike to.\n\nThere are many great locations to explore. Stroll through the <b>Bamboo Forest</b> or hike to the <b>Thousand Leaves Temple</b> in Senbamachi.  See the <b>Historic Traveler's Shrine</b> or hike over frozen bridges to the <b>Natural Cove</b> in Yukimatsu.\n\nThese hikes are very peaceful and provide a great social experience, but be wary of any active wildlife in the area."--></T>
