That's the heart of the town and where most of the action is.  There's also Pendula View. It's quieter, but it's also the most historic part of town. Plus, there's a gorgeous community garden there. And if you're lucky, you'll catch the ferry coming through. \n\nNow, if you're interested in something a bit more adventurous... you could always seek out the fabled Sylvan Glade. It's rumored that to find it, you have to befriend a magical tree. I'm sure that's all just superstition though."--></T>
