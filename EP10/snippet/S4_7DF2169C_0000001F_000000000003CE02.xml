You must prepare if you hope to reach the peak in once piece.\n\nPrepare a good group of climbers. They should all have at least level 6 rock climbing skill to have a chance of scaling the largest rock walls. Purchase rock climbing equipment and choose to depart when mountain conditions are not icy. Slips and falls can be painful and even <b>deadly!</b>\n\nPack a good amount of supplies for the trip. There will be no food on the climb. Shelter and locations to relieve yourself will be limited. You should also stock up on deterrents for possible wildlife encounters.\n\nConditions and accessible routes on the mountain will change. Expect new challenges during each attempt."--></T>
