Whiskerman's Wharf is always a favorite hangout of the locals—lots of fishermen and cats. If you head on down to Cavalier Cove we have a lot of walking trails. Great people. Great pets. \n\nAnd oh! How could I forget about Deadgrass Isle? There's a lot of mystery surrounding that place. Some say it's haunted. Makes sense given the old pet cemetery out there. It's the site of an old shipwreck too. Most visiting just go to see the lighthouse though. Kind of creepy."--></T>
