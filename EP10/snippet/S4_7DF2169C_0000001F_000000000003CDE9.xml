Bathing in public is not a taboo here. Many Sims will find this an ideal relaxation location to warm up after a fun day on the slopes.\n\nClimbers preparing for their ascent up Mt. Komorebi will gather here to prepare for the journey. It is a great place to do final gear and supply checks. "--></T>
