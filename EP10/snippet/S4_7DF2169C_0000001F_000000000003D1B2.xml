For starters, you'll want to check out the Puerto Llamante Marketplace. That's the best place to meet locals and learn about our culture. The market stalls also sell a lot of helpful items, especially if you're going to be heading off into the jungle.\n\nIt's not uncommon for adventurers to visit, seeking treasure and ruins in the Omiscan ruins. It's pretty dangerous though. Some say the jungle is cursed."--></T>
