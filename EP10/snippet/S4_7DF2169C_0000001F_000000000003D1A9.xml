I can't think of a better place to raise a family. \n\nThere's Llama Lagoon, which has a nice golf course and a public playground. Ridgeline Drive, which is perfect if you're looking for something more rustic. Lots of hiking trails on the edge of town. Bridgeview is closer to the city, but it's still very family friendly. Plus, it has a really nice picnic area."--></T>
