      <T n="text">0x327815B2<!--String: "To start a Mountain Climb Excursion your sims will have to 'Plan a Social Event' from their phones. You will find the Mountain Climb Excursion selectable. Choose at least 2 Sims to go on the excursion and then head to the Sutefani Onsen Bathhouse. Ride the gondola to the top where you will find the first rock wall to scale and the trail map marker leading to the next segment of the climb."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x2E292171<!--String: "A mountain climb excursion will be tough. It is likely you will not make it all the way to the summit. Preparation is key to success.\n\n<b>High Rock Climbing Skill</b> is essential. The tallest rock walls cannot be scaled until your Sims reach the upper skill levels. Even then, there is a chance of falling to your death, so it is best to know what you are doing."--></T>

You can find out more in the Rock Climbing Lesson.\n\n<b>Food & Shelter</b> is a good idea to bring along. You might not find a tent at all base camps, so it is a good idea to have one with you. Also bring plenty of food and drink. There are many tasty snacks in the vending machines around town that will work. Or better yet, make some energy bars yourself to take along."--></T>
