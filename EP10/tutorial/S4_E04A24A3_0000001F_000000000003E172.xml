      <T n="text">0x76B6FAD1<!--String: "Lifestyles are an expression of a Sim’s behaviors and habits over time. Each Lifestyle provides unique rewards and may influence the autonomy of a Sim living it. Some Lifestyles are opposites of each other and cannot be gained at the same time. Others are solo Lifestyles and can be combined with any other pairing. Lifestyles also have a variety of statuses which include: Hidden, Locked, In Progress, Active, and At Risk.\n\nThe Lifestyles panel is housed within the Simology Panel. Active Lifestyles will be visible in this panel once they have been earned. Click on the “Lifestyles” button to open a menu detailing all of the Lifestyles. Hover over a Lifestyle to learn more about it. "--></T>

      <T n="text">0xAF315812<!--String: "A handful of Lifestyles begin with the “Hidden” status within each Sims 4 save file. These Lifestyles have not been discovered yet. They can be revealed through natural gameplay habits relating to that “Hidden” Lifestyle. Explore the game to discover them! Once revealed, Hidden lifestyles will never return to their Hidden state, and are available to progress in for all Sims within that save game."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xCC2A3A0B<!--String: "Once a Sim makes a certain amount of progress in a Lifestyle, that Lifestyle will unlock the “In Progress” status. This means that if a Sim continues to participate in behavior representative of  that Lifestyle, they will eventually unlock the Lifestyle, making it “Active.” Doing the opposite behavior (when applicable) or neglecting a Lifestyle over time will cause a Lifestyle to return to its “Locked” status.  A Sim can only work towards or against a Lifestyle so much in a given day. "--></T>

This will automatically slot the “Active” Lifestyle into the Sim’s Lifestyle panel, granting them the gameplay effects noted in the Lifestyle’s description. A Sim may only have up to three “Active” Lifestyles at any given time. To replace a currently “Active” Lifestyle with another, a Sim would need to first lose one of the original “Active” Lifestyles."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xBF1EAAC3<!--String: "“At Risk” Lifestyles are “Active” Lifestyles that are currently at risk of going away. This means a sim has either been ignoring their lifestyle entirely or doing behavior contrary to their lifestyle. If unaddressed, this will cause a Lifestyle to return to its “Locked” status.  As with “In Progress” Lifestyles, a Sim can only work towards or against a Lifestyle so much in a given day when it is “At Risk.” "--></T>

Lifestyles can be toggled back on at any time, but they will start fresh within the game save. "--></T>
