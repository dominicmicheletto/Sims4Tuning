      <T n="text">0xF196BCBE<!--String: "Perks are the key to building bigger, more efficient restaurants. They will allow you to make your restaurant more profitable and popular. Do not let them go unspent.\n\nThere are a wide variety of Perks to choose from. You can unlock the ability to hire additional employees. Spend Perk points to get a short term or permanent discount on ingredients. Learn how to recommend more expensive dishes to customers. There are even powerful bonuses that influence your customers to tolerate longer wait times or eat their meals faster. Perks that are purchased will be applied to every restaurant your household owns."--></T>

Instead employees can be improved separately by building their skills at various tasks. You can learn more about that in the “Restaurant - Employees” lesson."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x99DA4A76<!--String: "Earning Perk Points is simple - just have your Sims help out around the restaurant. Interacting with customers and managing employees will all provide some Perk Points. The more customers that come to the restaurant the more points you can earn. Employees will not earn Perk Points for you, so get to work!"--></T>
