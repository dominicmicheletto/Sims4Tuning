Select "Manage Employees" on your Owned Businesses panel to view a list of Sims to hire. Review their skills and their starting pay to determine if they're a good match for your restaurant.

If you can't find the perfect Sim with high skills to hire don't worry. Employees will slowly gain skills over time as they work. The best way to raise their skills quickly is to send them to after work training. Just be prepared to pay for this training."--></T>
