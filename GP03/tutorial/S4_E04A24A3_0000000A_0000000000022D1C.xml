They will also have no problem paying a high markup for high difficulty dishes cooked well.\n\nHosts and waiters with high skills will provide better service and put the customers in a better mood. Make sure you also have enough staff to keep the food coming out of the kitchen quickly.\n\nSpend time making your dining room a nice place to eat. It is hard for Sims to enjoy their meal if they have to close their eyes."--></T>
