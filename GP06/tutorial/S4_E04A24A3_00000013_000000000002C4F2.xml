The layout of this temple will change with each visit to Selvadorada. Walls will rearrange, traps will change, and treasure chests will shuffle.

The Sim must find and activate the correct triggers in order for the gate to unlock and reveal the next room. Sims can examine each trap which will reveal if a trigger is valid or not. However, the Sim's success at validating a trigger depends on their skill level and the Temple defense they are examining. Hover over the Examine interaction to see which skill is associated with the defense."--></T>
