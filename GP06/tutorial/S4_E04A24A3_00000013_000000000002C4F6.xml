      <T n="text">0xB82B7CD2<!--String: "Raising this skill is as simple as interacting with the Selvadoradians, trying their foods, and shopping in the open air market. Locals have a lot of knowledge.  Try asking them about local sights, the Omiscan Ruins, or about the jungle. Soon you will be able to use the Selvadoradian greetings or retell the local folk tales."--></T>

Seek out Sims wearing the local fashion or working the local shops.\n\nLocals will have unique socials. During emergencies Sims can trade Bone Dust for Poison Antidotes with locals."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x4A69B72D<!--String: "A Sim with a high Selvadoradian Culture Skill can dance the Rumbasim. This is the hottest dance craze in Selvadorada.\n\nA high skilled Sim also has access to the secret menu with vendors in the Puerto Llamante Marketplace. Click on a vendor and choose 'Purchase Secret Items'. A high skill also allows Sims to ward off lightning bugs and firefly natural dangers without the need of adventure gear. But really, it's all about the Rumbasim."--></T>
