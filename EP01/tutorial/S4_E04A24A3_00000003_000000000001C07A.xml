      <T n="text">0x9DAC34C3<!--String: "Running a business is no small task, but fortunately you can hire employees to offload some work. Select "Manage Employees" on your store's register to view a list of Sims to hire. Review their skills and their starting pay to determine if they're a good match for your store. If you don't like the list of applicants, simply try again later.\n\nOnce you've found someone to hire, you may want to assign them a work uniform. You can use your cash register to design a uniform and assign it to all of your employees, or you can click directly on an employee and customize a uniform that's unique to them."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x465A49C<!--String: "Since your Sim is the boss, they can dictate what the employees do during the work shift.  The “Assign Work Task” interaction appears when clicking on the employee. They can be instructed to do things such as assisting customers, restocking items, or cleaning the store. Assign a variety of tasks to your employees to make your store run at peak efficiency."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xE563516B<!--String: "Employees have three different skills that determine how well they work: Sales, Maintenance, and Work Ethic. Sales focuses on how successful they are at interacting with customers, and how quickly they can ring up shoppers who are ready to buy. Maintenance involves how fast employees will restock items and clean. Having a high Work Ethic reduces the chance that employees will decide to slack off during their shift."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x43C9E54F<!--String: "Use the "Manage Employees" interaction on the register to quickly check the status of your employees. You can view their skills and current pay level, and see how satisfied they are with their employment. You can use this panel to give a worthy employee a raise, punish an employee with a demotion, or outright fire a worker who isn't working out."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x580E43A5<!--String: "An employee's satisfaction is raised by being paid appropriately for their skill level, receiving praise from the boss, and from positive social interactions. Berating your employees, demoting them, or working them longer than eight hours per shift are just some of the ways to lower their satisfaction. If they get too upset, don't be surprised when they quit!"--></T>

      <T n="text">0x3C11F14D<!--String: "While your employees are on the job, be sure to keep an eye on them as they may slack off from time to time. If you catch them playing with their phone, socializing with each other, or goofing around having fun, be sure to select "Berate For Slacking" on them to get them working again. Berating a Sim that was slacking will actually help raise their work ethic skill over time."--></T>

See the "Retail - Perks" lesson for more details. Additionally, any member of your household that’s a teen or older can pitch in and help manage the store."--></T>
