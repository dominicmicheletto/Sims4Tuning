      <T n="text">0x7EF7806A<!--String: "The prices you set in your store are an important factor in the ease of selling items to customers. If you go for clearance pricing, customers may not need any convincing to make a purchase. If you set your prices to exorbitant though, be ready to spend time applying pressure and go for the hard sale to get them to hand over their money."--></T>

The bar will move when you use retail social interactions on the customer. If it reaches the top, they'll immediately buy! If not, they still might choose to purchase something when they're finished shopping."--></T>

They can be just window shopping, receptive to your sales pitch, or interested in buying. The higher their interest is, the more retail social interactions unlock for you to use on them."--></T>

Either your Sim or your employees can ring the customer up to complete the purchase - another satisfied customer! If you leave them waiting too long though, you'll lose the sale as they give up and leave."--></T>
