      <T n="text">0x870019<!--String: "There are a variety of retail displays and pedestals that you can place in your store to show off your wares. They can be found in the Retail Items section of the Build Catalog while editing your retail store. Some displays are themed for selling particular items; for example, you can easily drag food that you've just cooked onto the display shelves without even entering Build Mode."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x3F812CAE<!--String: "Food and drinks that are placed on refrigerated displays will take much longer to spoil; making them ideal for creating stores like a bakery. Setting a perishable item to be For Sale anywhere in your store will also extend its shelf life before it spoils."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xA4B8A5B6<!--String: "The Retail Freezer object is unique. It has an inventory which you can place perishable items inside and then have them be sold to customers. Any item within its inventory will automatically be considered purchasable. As customers purchase items from it, you'll need to manually restock its inventory. If you visit a store as a customer though, you can purchase as many items from the freezer's inventory as you desire without it running out of stock."--></T>
