      <T n="text">0xA6112B6C<!--String: "Mannequins allow you to run a clothing store that sells fashions of your own creation. Mannequins are purchased from Build Mode, and can be customized and dressed after they've been placed on the lot. They come in two different styles, and are available for adults and children of each gender."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x4ED4738<!--String: "When mannequins are first placed on the lot they don't arrive with any clothes to sell. Interact with the mannequin to create outfits in Create A Sim, or roll the dice on a random outfit if you're in a hurry. You can also edit the shape of a mannequin in Create A Sim the same way you would with a Sim."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xA68ADC72<!--String: "You can create outfits that are shared between each type of mannequin (Adult Male, Adult Female, Child Male, Child Female) per lot. To create additional outfits in Create A Sim, click on the outfit category (e.g. Swimwear), then click on the arrow above the category. Here you can add up to 5 outfits per category, for a grand total of 30 unique outfits."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x5C1BC543<!--String: "Once your mannequin is dressed, you're ready for customers to come try on and purchase your fashions! You can dress the mannequin in outfits you've created anytime at no charge, but you will need to pay a fee when restocking your mannequin following a customer's purchase. You'll know it's time to restock when you see the out of stock necklace replace your mannequin's clothing."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x9F7DF41A<!--String: "Mannequins do have some limitations to keep in mind. You can have a maximum of 10 per lot, and they can't exceed 30 outfits per type of mannequin per lot. That means that you can have mannequins on different lots wearing entirely different outfits, but if you move them to be on the same lot, some outfits will be lost in the process so as to not exceed the 30 outfit limit."--></T>
