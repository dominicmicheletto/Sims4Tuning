      <T n="text">0x25CDF034<!--String: "To purchase advertising, click on your store's cash register and select either Web or TV advertising. Each type of advertising can be purchased for a one time upfront fee, and comes in short or long blocks of time. Web advertising provides a quick spike of customers that fades off towards the end, while a television ad provides a consistent boost of customers over the duration of the campaign."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x69111CBD<!--String: "Signage is another great way to attract customers and boost your curb appeal. There are a variety of retail signs available in the catalog that match a variety of wares. Retail neon signs really catch the attention of Sims as well! Sims with the handiness skill can even upgrade their neon signs to animate or break less often."--></T>
