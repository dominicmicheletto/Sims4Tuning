These will then be used to discover new compounds and devices.\n\nYour Sim's creations can lead to new discoveries or inventions!"--></T>

      <T n="text">0xF7E89D65<!--String: "As a scientist, your Sim will want to invent new technology. In order to create new inventions, they must do research.\n\nWhen your Sim researches or experiments they will begin to build Breakthrough (identified by a light bulb on interactions). When they have a Breakthrough a new invention or serum will become available to them. These can be viewed in the notebook (located at the top of the phone menu) to view crafting notes."--></T>

Sims must first have a Breakthrough, then have the appropriate materials to construct devices. Sims who are higher in the scientist career will have a better chance at creating a device that actually works. Scientists can Brainstorm with the constructor, which will help towards the next Breakthrough."--></T>
