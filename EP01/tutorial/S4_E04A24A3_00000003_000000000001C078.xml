      <T n="text">0x6C46B3F9<!--String: "Sims can own a store to sell various items and earn Simoleons. To open a store, use the Phone or Computer and select "Buy Retail Store." You can buy an existing store, or purchase any unoccupied lot and start from scratch. Better yet, there's no limit to the number of stores you can own! Retail stores are owned by the household (and not per Sim); as such, you can own a store while maintaining a separate career."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xBA94D6D<!--String: "You'll need two things to open a store… a cash register, and something to sell. What you sell is entirely up to you! It can be an item from the Build Mode catalog, something your Sim has crafted, something your Sim has collected out in the world, or you can even dress a mannequin and sell clothing. Once you've decided what you're selling, click on the item and mark it as "For Sale." Next, click on your cash register and select "Open Store.""--></T>

You can restock the item yourself at cost (the amount it's sold for in Build Mode), or instruct one of your employees to keep the store stocked. There are Retail Perks you can earn that allow you to restock faster, or have restocking cost less money. Read the "Retail - Perks" lesson for more details."--></T>
