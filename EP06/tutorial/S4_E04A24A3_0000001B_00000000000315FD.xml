      <T n="text">0x637D9D78<!--String: "There are many different ways to become a celebrity. As your Sim progresses in their skills and careers, more paths to stardom will become available. Some great ways to start becoming famous include pursuing a career in Acting, or raising the Media Production Skill via the Video Station or Music Station objects. Every Sim that's a child or older can become famous, although children are capped at two star celebrities.\n\nLook for interactions labeled with <font color='#199C2C'>(+▰Fame)</font>; each of these will contribute towards becoming a super star!"--></T>

      <T n="text">0xB5A6AA96<!--String: "As your Sim raises their celebrity level, they'll earn Fame Points, which can be used to purchase Fame Perks. Perks unlock a wide variety of benefits for your famous Sim! They'll also earn Fame Quirks, which modify their behavior. Both Fame Perks and Fame Quirks have unique lessons where you can learn more."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x5FD9930E<!--String: "As your Sim becomes more famous, other Sims will start to take note. You may spot Paparazzi following you around and taking your photo, or fans of yours eagerly approaching you for a moment of your time. You can even host Celebrity Meet & Greet events, where you can choose the time and place for interacting with your adoring fans. All of this attention can be a bit overwhelming though... Once you become a three star celebrity, you can use a mirror to wear a Celebrity Disguise, which will shield you from being recognized when you're out in public. "--></T>

      <T n="text">0xAA227F24<!--String: "Fame can be fleeting. If you don't regularly perform actions that gain fame, your Sim may start fading from the public's consciousness. When this occurs, your fame level will slowly drop, and you may even lose your celebrity level. That said, you can never lose more than two levels of fame. This is all easily avoidable-you'll receive a warning when your fame is about to start decaying, and any interaction that provides <font color='#199C2C'>(+▰Fame)</font> will prevent your fame from dropping. The higher your celebrity level, the longer it takes for your fame to start decaying."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x2C06389F<!--String: "One important detail to remember is that any Sim outside of your current household will never gain fame, and will never lose fame. If you play with different households of Sims, your Sim's fame will be the same level where you left off when you swap back to a previously played household."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xC9EAFEC4<!--String: "You have control over which Sims become famous. In the options menu, you can toggle if all Sims are allowed to gain fame or not by default. Regardless of how you set this global option, you can also turn fame on or off for individual Sims. Simply open the Fame Info panel for the Sim you want to adjust, and select "Quit the Spotlight". Once selected, this Sim will never become a celebrity. If you change your mind, you can adjust this option again at any time."--></T>
