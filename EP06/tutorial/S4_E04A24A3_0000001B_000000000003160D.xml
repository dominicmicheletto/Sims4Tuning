      <T n="text">0x422951FE<!--String: "There are three new lot traits that custom-tailor the ‘celebrity experience’ on various lot types. The two non-residential traits are <b>Hottest Spot in Town</b> and <b>Up-and-Coming Hotspot</b>. These traits will modify how often celebrities show up, what rank these celebrities will usually be, and a variety of other gameplay effects. <b>Celebrity Home</b> is a trait made specifically for residential lots. Though anyone can live on a lot with this trait, only households containing a high-tier celebrity will reap the benefits. Others may periodically find themselves a little embarrassed."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xB563C7A5<!--String: "A VIP door or archway works well in conjunction with any of the Celebrity Lot Traits. Using any of the four VIP doors will ensure a space is primarily only accessible to celebrities of a defined rank. This can be used to create a celebrity-only venue or VIP room within a venue. After loading onto a lot in live mode, click on the door itself to set the fame rank allowance for each individual door."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xA4FFBD63<!--String: "Be sure to remove or lock any other doors that might allow Sims to bypass a VIP Rope door. Otherwise, those silly Sims will simply sneak in the back! Also, be aware: Placing one of these doors without a Celebrity Lot Trait might mean a lot doesn’t receive many celebrity visitors and could be fairly dead inside."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xC89B8F57<!--String: "Bouncers can be hired on any ownable venue type by clicking on the door and choosing “Hire Bouncer.” If a household owns that venue, they may also “Fire Bouncer.” Bouncers will automatically arrive and assign themselves to a door (up to three doors per lot) on any other non-ownable lot type. By interacting with a bouncer, a player or NPCs may attempt to Bribe, Convince, or Fight to get past the VIP door’s fame restrictions. Once allowed access, a Sim will be able to enter a door manned by that bouncer (while the bouncer remains active for that shift)."--></T>
