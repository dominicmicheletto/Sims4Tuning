      <T n="text">0xE166DE46<!--String: "A Sim's reputation shapes how other Sims in the world interact with and react to you. There are seven different levels of a Sim's reputation, from Pristine to Atrocious. Every Sim that's a child or older will form a reputation through the actions they take. Reputation is formed based on the idea of treating others the same way you would wish to be treated. Simply going about your life isn't enough to form a reputation... A Sim must go out of their way to be kind or mean to have their reputation change. In many cases, a Sim's good or bad behavior must be observed by another Sim for their reputation to actually be affected."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x7F762E4A<!--String: "Having a positive reputation unlocks a number of benefits for your Sim...\n\nIf you're considered to be "Good", you'll often form stronger starting friendships with new Sims that you introduce yourself to.\n\nUpon reaching a "Great" reputation, your Sim will occasionally be offered various opportunities from other Sims such as getting invited to a Charity Benefit Party, receiving job offers that allow you to start a career at higher levels, getting set up on a blind date, and more. Romantic introductions you attempt will have a chance of starting you at higher relationship levels. You'll also automatically receive a boost to the scoring in any social events that your Sim hosts, making it easier to earn rewards.\n\nUpon achieving a "Pristine" reputation, you'll be able to host your own Charity Benefit Party. This new event has a variety of new rewards to collect. Friendships you form will last longer, and Sims you pass by within the world will react positively to your mere presence."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xA88B1A56<!--String: "Having a negative reputation will unlock a different range of benefits, and modify the types of Sims who react positively to you.\n\nWith a "Bad" reputation, introductions with new Sims aren't likely to go well... but if you happen to meet another Sim with bad reputation, or who happens to be Evil or Mean, you may find yourself with a stronger starting relationship.\n\nWhen your reputation turns "Awful", many new opportunities will occasionally occur. You might get invited to attend a Lampoon Party, receive an offer to join the Criminal career at a high rank, or be introduced to friends or romantic interests who also happen to be societal outcasts, and more.\n\nUpon reaching an "Atrocious" reputation, you'll be able to host a Lampoon Party, where you can choose a guest of honor to roast. Sims around the world will react negatively as you walk by. Making friends can be difficult with this poor of a rep, but thankfully you can now bribe other Sims for their friendship, or for advancement opportunities in your career."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xC2D2F456<!--String: "There are a few other details about your Sim's reputation to keep in mind...\n\nReputation can be affected by a Sim's fame. The more famous a Sim is, the faster their reputation can change. In addition, there are certain fame perks that require a positive or negative reputation to be able to unlock.\nFinally, a Sim's reputation is never adjusted unless they're a current member of the active household that you're playing. If you play with different households of Sims, your Sim's reputation will be the same level where you left off when you swap back to a previously played household."--></T>
