      <T n="text">0xABFD83A8<!--String: "As a Sim increases their Celebrity Level, they'll unlock the ability to acquire Fame Quirks. Quirks are behavioral oddities that famous Sims earn, as their celebrity lifestyle sets them apart from a normal Sim's day to day life. Quirks are not chosen, they are assigned to your Sim based on the actions your Sim performs. Quirks can be seen within the Fame Info panel, and each one provides a hint as to the type of behavior which will cause them to be triggered."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x2E622B12<!--String: "There are two ways to remove a Fame Quirk...\n\nFirst, your Sim can spend Satisfaction Points in the Reward Store to buy a Quirk-B-Gone potion. This potion will remove any quirk of your choosing, and can be used as often as you like.\n\nSecond, your Sim can purchase and wear a Celestial Crystal Crown. If a rare crystal is slotted into the crown, then the crown can be used to remove a quirk of your choosing.\n\nThere is no way to permanently remove a quirk slot from a Sim."--></T>
