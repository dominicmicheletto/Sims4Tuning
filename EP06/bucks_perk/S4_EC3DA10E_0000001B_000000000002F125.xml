  <T n="perk_description">0x1EE814A1<!--String: "<font color='#1E81E6'>Hates physical contact with strangers.</font>\n\nTrigger:\n• Being touched by strangers with less Fame than {0.SimFirstName}.\n\nBehavior:\n• Celebrities are forced to live their lives with little privacy, but invasions of their personal space still crosses a line. When they find themselves touched by non-famous Sims who aren't in their family, or who they aren't in a committed relationship with, they may grow to dread physical contact. They put on a smile for a fan who wants a friendly hug, but inside they feel tense, unhappy about the lack of respect for their boundaries. However, should they manage to avoid direct contact for awhile, they gain a renewed sense of confidence to take on the world."--></T>
