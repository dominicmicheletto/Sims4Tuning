  <T n="perk_description">0xF7A1F6DF<!--String: "<font color='#1E81E6'>Gain a stan that obsesses over you.</font>\n\nTrigger:\n• Signing autographs for fans.\n\nBehavior:\n• Some fans take fandom a bit too seriously. These misguided Sims are known amongst celebrities as "stans". Thankfully stans don't mean you any harm, they just have a burning desire for you to know that you're the center of their universe. Their behavior manifests itself in a variety of ways, from attempting to chat with you while out in public, to showing up at your residence and digging through your trash cans. Should you choose to invite one into your home, keep a close eye on them... They'll always look for a chance to swipe a souvenir from their favorite superstar."--></T>
