      <T n="text">0xE6EC8301<!--String: "Once your Sims are engaged, there are a few ways to plan a wedding or wedding event. Wedding events can be planned via the Computer, Phone, or Calendar. Events planned on the Computer and Phone will happen on the current day, while scheduling an event through the Calendar will let you schedule one on the day that you select. You will also have the ability to go back and edit events after they have been scheduled, the only requirements will be that you have selected the required Sims and a time and place for the event."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xD7F8130A<!--String: "All Wedding Events have the ability to select Activities that help customize the event to fit your Sims. Each Wedding Event has a specific selection of Activities that are appropriate for that type of event. There is no limit to the number of activities that you select. While Activities will be listed to remind you during the event, there is no downside if you decide to not run these activities while the event is active."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xAB4E1A7C<!--String: "Wedding Ceremony events have a few extra special selections available that can make your Sim's special day more unique. Your Sims can ask their friends and family to be part of their wedding as a Sim of Honor, an Officiant, a Ring Bearer, or a Flower Pal. Once Sims have been asked to be one of these special roles, you will be able to select them for this role in the Wedding Ceremony planner."--></T>

Only the primary formal outfit will be selected for Wedding Ceremony event, but once the event has started you can change to any outfit you choose. You will also be able to request that Sims show up in a specific color, or clothing style under the Guest Attire section. There is also a spot to view your cake once you have selected one for your wedding."--></T>
