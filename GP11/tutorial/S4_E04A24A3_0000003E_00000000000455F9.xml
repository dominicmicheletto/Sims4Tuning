      <T n="text">0x578B9AD9<!--String: "For many, Wedding Cakes are one of the most important things at a wedding. In Tartosa's Porto Luminoso, Sims are able to taste a variety of cake flavors at the patisserie stand near the village square. After the all-important tasting, Sims will be able to purchase Wedding cakes through a computer, at the patisserie stand, or make one themselves if they have the gourmet cooking skill."--></T>

For most tables, the cake will need to be in the center, but for a larger round table it will need to be a little closer to the edge for Sims to reach it."--></T>
