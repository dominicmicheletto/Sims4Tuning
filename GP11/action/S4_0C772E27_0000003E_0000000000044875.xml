What a charming Sim. Did you know he used to be a hatmaker for llamas? Hated it. You have to chase your dreams, even if it does lead you away from llamas from time to time. "--></T>

I've been trying to get Camille to write one about the area for years. A historical fiction, drama'd up to be fun."--></T>

A lot of Sims who come here to get married take pictures there, but it's beautiful for paintings as well. Just imagine what some of those old trees have witnessed in days gone by. If I stand still enough, I sometimes swear I can hear the trees communicating. But that's silly, isn't it? I know, I sound like an overly whimsical artist, don't I? "--></T>

                  <T>0xD83F072C<!--String: "Have you noticed the hill on the side of Porto Luminoso? You can get the most beautiful top down views of the village from there. A new perspective does wonders to shake things up if you're feeling a bit stuck."--></T>

                  <T>0xCBEB8C7B<!--String: "About a decade ago, I spent a lot of time painting Thebe Estate. Camille was fascinated by its history and it inspired something in me as well. Arnessa was always kind enough to bring tea out to me as I worked. A spot of black tea really gets the mind percolating."--></T>
                  <T>0x6F3B2F74<!--String: "Sometimes I paint Sims and not scenes. After Camille, Faiz is my favorite. He has such a light in his eyes. It's the exuberance of youth, I imagine, though there's something unique about Faiz that I truly admire. "--></T>
