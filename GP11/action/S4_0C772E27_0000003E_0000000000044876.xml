                  <T>0xE3236DFB<!--String: "Why is Tartosa famous for its pastries? Well, its where the tart was invented! Lady Matilda Tartosa loved fruit, you see, and one of her suitors created the dessert to impress her- going so far as to name it after her. Demand for the confectionary went up when the pirates started arriving to trade their stolen llamas. At that point, there was what is now known as 'The Great Tart Crisis." Due to a lack of supply, other pastries had to be made to satisfy the needs of supply and demand. Lucky for me, I can also grab a macaron anytime I like, too."--></T>
                  <T>0xF4ED1AC7<!--String: "Rodrigo De Pablo was Princess Cordelia's third pirate boyfriend - yes, third! - and perhaps the greatest love of her life. It's said he was rather clumsy, and there's a lot of historical speculation around how he actually died. Some say his peg leg caught on fire aboard the Eppsilon, the Princess' ship. Others say he had an affair with Lady Tartosa and Princess Cordelia hired a witch to trap him inside a glass bottle she cast out to sea. I've also heard he choked on a tart, which seems the least ridiculous to me. Either way, history knows that when Princess Cordelia departed Tartosa, her beloved Rodrigo was not with her."--></T>
                  <T>0xC532CDCA<!--String: "Tartosa is famous for its history with pirates. In the old days, they used to steal llamas and bring them here for a quick trade. Sometimes for gold, sometimes for tarts and pastries (and lots of them, I'd wager). Porto Luminoso is almost as famous for its tarts and pastries as it is for its history with pirates."--></T>
                  <T>0x7E495D61<!--String: "People are always asking me why its assumed that Arnessa Thebe is related to Princess Cordelia, since its well-known that Princess Cordelia left. Well, after a bit of digging, I discovered some evidence at City Hall stating that twenty years after she left, a gentleman by the name of Rodrigo Thebe returned. He claimed that his father had died here and his mother was the late Princess. With his vast fortune, Rodrigo had Thebe Estate built. Supposedly, there are some ancestors still around today."--></T>
                  <T>0x47A52232<!--String: "No, Princess Cordelia wasn't originally from here. Her kingdom was not too far away across the sea. When the Great Sloth Invasion took place, she escaped on her submersible, the Eppsilon, with her first pirate boyfriend Captain Long John Buttercups. They didn't come here though. She came here much later—and with a different pirate. That Cordelia certainly had a type, didn't she? "--></T>
                  <T>0x93FF50B8<!--String: "History will never know exactly why Princess Cordelia left Tartosa. We know she was one of the first Sims to explore the arctic waters in her submersible, the Eppsilon, and that was after she had already left. But why? Perhaps she, like the locals, was afraid it was only a matter of time before the dreaded sloths swam to our shores. Or perhaps she was an adventurer at heart, unable to settle in one spot for long. Maybe it was the death of her beloved Rodrigo that pushed her away? We'll never know for sure, but I certainly love thinking about it."--></T>
                  <T>0xEA715346<!--String: "I asked about the Lover's Tree when I arrived here. Most believe that long ago, a local shipwright carved the likeness of Princess Cordelia and Rodrigo De Pablo into the figurehead of a ship. When the ship sank, those who remembered their love carried it to the top of the hill by Hideaway Falls as a reminder. A year passed, and it magically began to sprout leaves and branches: a sign that their love lived on even though Rodrigo had passed. But I think, as romantic as that is, sometimes a tree is just a tree. Dominique is utterly fascinated by it all the same, though."--></T>
                  <T>0x968F3189<!--String: "A few years ago, famous artist, Igor Klobučar, was paid by Porto Luminoso to create an installation around the theme of romantic love. You'll find his finished piece, The Glass Heart, over in the gardens. The material represents the fragility of something as precious as love and the twists and turns we go through to find it. The two strands reminds us that its a journey you take with another person, too. They intertwine; crossing ways as Sims in love often do."--></T>
                  <T>0x65E55113<!--String: "The Tartosa locals at the time of the Great Sloth Invasion were terrified the sloths might make it here. After all, sloths are surprisingly strong swimmers. They use their long arms to propel through the water at an alarming speed they're never able to attain on land. Thankfully, they never reached our shores. We might not be here today if they had. I shudder to think!"--></T>
                  <T>0x474C7737<!--String: "There's a long list of pirates who visited here. Some of the most famous were Rodrigo De Pablo, of course, Two-Eye Charlie - later known as One-Eye Charlie -  plus Captain Rachael the Fearsome, Raider Rad who, well, raided, Dash who was the shortest yet fastest pirate ever, Five Finger Fran, First Mate Barnacle Bob, and even the Dread Pirate Morgan on the Red Annie."--></T>
                  <T>0x50063749<!--String: "There's some evidence suggesting that Princess Cordelia and Lady Matilda Tartosa were very close during her stay here. It's unlikely they were lovers, given the Princess' feelings for Rodrigo. Still, the princess and Lady Tartosa spent a lot of time together at the beach, sailing the coast and devouring tarts. There's also evidence suggesting their relationship ended on rocky terms, but nobody knows for certain why. Some think Lady Tartosa had an affair with Rodrigo. Others believe she stiffed Princess Cordelia on a fruit tart, which was a serious offense back in those days. Frankly, it's a serious offense these days as well, given the quality of the tarts here."--></T>
                  <T>0xB391195D<!--String: "Lady Matilda Tartosa was the last of the nobles in Tartosa. She never married, nor had a lover—despite having a dazzling array of suitors. Nobody knows why. What we do know is that she lived out her days here, a diligent steward of her position and privilege, eventually dying of old age. In her last days, she saw the land given back to the people who have run it together ever since. "--></T>
                  <T>0x80E3344D<!--String: "Lady Matilda Tartosa is perhaps the area's most famous noble. We don't have lords or ladies here anymore, of course. She was the youngest of three children and the last to inherit her title. Her eldest sister, Gianna, loved maps and left to chart the world, never returning. Her brother, Luca, was next in line and something of an astronomer. He would spend his nights looking up into the sky through a telescope he invented himself. It's said one night he simply disappeared. Nobody knows what happened to him. They both left Matilda here on her own, and she proved to be a very fruitful steward of the area. Most notably she increased trade and gave the area its first real staple: desserts. "--></T>
                  <T>0x97A4B42E<!--String: "The Tartosa area was originally settled by the Tartosa family. They had a castle along the cliffs, but the section it was on fell into the water, never to be seen again. I occasionally wonder if it would be worthwhile to dive and look for artifacts, but Dominique tells me that it'd be a fool's errand."--></T>
                  <T>0x471359FE<!--String: "Back in the old days, pirates were always arriving at port to trade their stolen llamas for tarts and treats. There was one llama, however, that became something of a town legend. His name was Doug. They say he could spit over forty feet, which is utterly ridiculous. But that's not why he's famous, in fact. One day, a Pirate named Two-Eye Charlie arrived to steal back the llamas, and the villagers were too terrified to fight back. Doug wasn't afraid. He spat directly into Two-Eye Charlie's eye, renaming him One-Eye Charlie. He left in rather a hurry soon thereafter!"--></T>
                  <T>0x4E1FBCF6<!--String: "Was Thebe Estate built with pirate's gold? Most people seem to think so, but there's no substantial evidence in the City Hall records. It <i>was</i> quite an expensive investment, but who knows where the money came from. "--></T>
