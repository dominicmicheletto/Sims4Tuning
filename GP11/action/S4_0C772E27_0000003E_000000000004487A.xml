So much so that they moved out here just to start up a restaurant, then two, and then start catering for weddings."--></T>

There are a lot of legends about where it came from; something about a figurehead? I've also heard something about how it grew in a way that looked similar to doomed lovers who traveled here once.

As soon as I heard that she was basically royalty, I was on notice. I expected her to be a bit of a snob, but she's not at all. Whether she admits to it or not, she has a real penchant for mischief. She loves playing little pranks on people. I'm wondering if that's rubbed off a little too much on the kids..."--></T>
