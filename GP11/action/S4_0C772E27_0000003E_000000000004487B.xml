                  <T>0x411EF87<!--String: "Sims around here are always talking about how Arnessa Thebe once sailed a little rowboat over Hideaway Falls? She broke a leg—literally. That's why they put in the bridge—to keep Sims from trying to sail over!"--></T>
                  <T>0x438906BE<!--String: "Aren't the hot air balloons in the sky romantic?"--></T>
                  <T>0x6655FB58<!--String: "We see so many proposals here! It's the romantic aura of the land. Also, it's great for dates! Off the top of my head, you could take a dip at the base of Hideaway Falls, watch the glowing waves at night, take a walk on the beach, or visit Porto Luminoso's Village fountain. The Lover's Tree is also a popular destination, of course."--></T>
                  <T>0x64153C40<!--String: "The Porto Luminoso fountain is always a romantic spot to visit. I always see couples cuddled up on the edge."--></T>
                  <T>0xD229A224<!--String: "The City Hall offers quick weddings for those visiting who can't wait another day. Sometimes love just won't let you wait, eh?"--></T>
                  <T>0x9D8226D6<!--String: "Did you know that if you visit the beach at night you might see the ocean glow? Some say that's what attracted Princess Cordelia to Tartosa back in the day."--></T>
                  <T>0xDE7AE859<!--String: "Don't forget to visit the local patisserie in Tartosa. We're famous for our fruit tarts and pastries, but it's also great if you want to sample some of the amazing wedding cakes they can whip up."--></T>
                  <T>0x5B49E8A4<!--String: "Have you noticed the flower cart in town? They get their flowers locally, for the most part. If you wanted, you could probably even go out and pick some of your own. "--></T>
                  <T>0x18B8C2D1<!--String: "Did you know that the fruit we use in our world-famous tarts is local fruit? Yeah! You could even go out and pick your own if you wanted."--></T>
                  <T>0x48E91267<!--String: "Ages ago, a local shipwright carved the likeness of Princess Cordelia and her pirate lover, Rodrigo De Pablo, into the figurehead of a ship. When the ship sank those who remembered their love carried the figurehead to the top of the hill by Hideaway Falls as a reminder. A year passed and it magically began to sprout leaves and branches, a sign that their love lived on even though Rodrigo had passed. Today, you can visit the tree, and if your heart is pure, some of that love magic will rub off on you!"--></T>
                  <T>0x325842DA<!--String: "Everyone knows about the glowing tides at night. It's said the strange glow used to draw in lost pirates, in fact. But the beaches have even more surprises in store, you know! If you search the shores, you'll sometimes find a message in a bottle. They wash up fairly regularly.  "--></T>
                  <T>0xDD9768EA<!--String: "It's a common rumor around here that when the Thebe Estate was built, construction was funded using a chest of pirate's gold. There's another rumor that after he built the Villa, Rodrigo Thebe buried the rest of the gold somewhere near the village. If you could find it, you'd be rich! Then again, they sure seemed to spend an awful lot to make that place look luxe, didn't they? Maybe all that's left is a bit of pocket change."--></T>
                  <T>0x29C48308<!--String: "They say Lady Matilda Tartosa used to live in a grand castle close to Hideaway Falls. Nobody can find the ruins, though. We do know that she used the Falls for illicit trades with pirates, but perhaps the castle ruins lie elsewhere."--></T>
