      <T n="text">0x8C70BBF1<!--String: "Running a Vet Clinic by yourself is entirely possible, but it’s going to be hard to juggle practicing veterinary medicine and the business side of things. It’s a good idea to hire employees to do some works like treating patients, crafting medicines, and ickier tasks like mopping up the floor. \nSelect “Manage Employees” on your Owned Businesses Panel to view a list of Sims to hire. Review their skills and starting pay to determine if they’re a good match for your Vet Clinic. If you don’t like the list of applicants, simply try again later and new Sims might apply."--></T>

If you can’t find the perfect Sim to hire, don’t worry! Employees will slowly gain skills over time as they work. The best way to raise an employee’s skills more quickly is to send them to after work training. Just be prepared to pay for it!"--></T>
