      <T n="text">0x650389C0<!--String: "True to any Pet, the Cats and Dogs in The Sims 4 misbehave. You will see them scratching the furniture, drinking from puddles, or even playing in the trash. While you could let this behavior continue, it’s best to teach your pet to stop these behaviors. When you see your cat or dog misbehaving you will see the option to Lecture or Scold them about this misbehavior. Select one of those options and your Sim will reprimand the cat or dog for the selected misbehavior."--></T>
