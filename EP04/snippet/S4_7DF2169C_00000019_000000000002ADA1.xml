That it still haunts it today! Unfinished business or some nonsense. But I've never seen nor heard it for as long as I've been here." By his slow movements, {0.SimFirstName} assumes that's quite some time.\n\n"You know what it is," the old man says. "I bet it's just some young rascals getting into our tablecloths we keep in storage and making out like they're a spirit."\n\nThe tour ends as abruptly as it began. As they head home, {0.SimFirstName} assures {1.SimFirstName} they'll return and figure out this whole ghost thing one way or another. {0.SimFirstName} looks back and a shiver goes down {M0.his}{F0.her} spine as {M0.he}{F0.she} sees the old man staring right at them from the darkened gift shop."--></T>

The man running the lighthouse at the time - one Mr. Friendly - had taken his dog to the vet, forgetting that a cargo ship was docking that night.\n\nThe lighthouse light was left off and the ship wrecked. While there were no deaths, a large crab shipment was lost and along with it, the lucrative contract Brindleton Bay had established with the crabbing company.\n\nThe man continues, "anyway, Mr. Friendly was sacked but his damn dog wouldn't leave the lighthouse and died soon after right in the office."\n\nThe tour ends soon after and {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} vow to return, though the story of the dog who died in the lighthouse haunts them on their way home."--></T>
