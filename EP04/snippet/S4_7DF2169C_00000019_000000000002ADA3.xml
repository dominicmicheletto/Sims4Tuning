"Heir to the Crabcakes fortune."\n\n"Yes," spits Charlie, "though not much of a fortune after the Brindleton Wreck where my dad's ship lost a year's supply of crabs! All because of that stupid Mr. Friendly and his sick dog." The ghost dog looks indignant and floats a few paces away.\n\n"I was going to turn the lighthouse off, make the big fish shipment crash, and Brindleton Bay was sure to give crabs another chance! And I would have gotten away with it, too, if hadn't been for these two meddling dogs!"\n\n"But...why the mask?" asks {0.SimFirstName}. Charlie wrenches himself away from {1.SimFirstName}, ditches his shoes, and hops to the edge of the lighthouse.\n\n"I've got tons of masks!" he shouts, adding "and I'll get my revenge! You'll see." He jumps and {0.SimFirstName} gasps, but Charlie spreads his arms and he has some kind of glider jacket that catches the wind, as he disappears into the darkness of the water below.\n\nIt's not really an answer, and {0.SimFirstName} is still confused, but it seems that they've done their good deed for the moment and made a new ghostly friend. The ghost dog licks {0.SimFirstName}'s face - which, for the record, feels super weird but also comforting - then disappears down into the heart of the lighthouse.\n\n{0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} head home, content."--></T>
