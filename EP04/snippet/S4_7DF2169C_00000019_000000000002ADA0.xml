"Some say it's the old pooch who belonged Mr. Friendly - the last person to run the lighthouse. Hanging around, unfinished business or some nonsense."\n\n"Mr. Friendly was let go when he let the lighthouse go dark, causing a shipwreck. That damn dog wouldn't leave, though, and died right in the lighthouse office."
