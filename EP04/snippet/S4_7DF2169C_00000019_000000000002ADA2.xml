He staggers backward, trips on {1.SimFirstName}, and falls with a thump onto the floor of the lookout.\n\n{1.SimFirstName} takes the man's hair in his mouth as {0.SimFirstName} approaches.

Uh oh. That doesn't sound good.\n\nSuddenly, something rises out of the crate in front of them, and it's all {0.SimFirstName} and {1.SimFirstName} can do to not shout. It's the ghost! The ethereal hound seems friendly though, and gestures at the crate, then at the old man. {0.SimFirstName} nods, knowing what to do."--></T>
