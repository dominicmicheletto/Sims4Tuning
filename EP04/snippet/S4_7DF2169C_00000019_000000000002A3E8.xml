"Who's there?" cries a voice from inside. {0.SimFirstName} takes a step back as the door opens to reveal an old woman with silvery hair swept up in a bun on her head. She's wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a long floral pink dress. "No solicitors!"\n\nBefore {0.SimFirstName} can respond, {1.SimFirstName} runs past both of them in through the cabin doors. "What's this!" she yells. "Get your animal off my skipper!" But just as quickly, {1.SimFirstName} comes running back out carrying a cardboard bag of what smells like fish. {M1.He}{F1.She} darts through the woman's legs, off the boat, and back up the harbor. {0.SimFirstName}'s dog has just committed robbery, so {M0.he}{F0.she} decides it's a good time to leave. As {1.SimFirstName} and {0.SimFirstName} head home, "My Trout!" echo in the distance."--></T>

The cabin is so low that {0.SimFirstName} has to bend down to get a look.\n\n Two green eyes and a set of whiskers are staring back at {0.SimFirstName}. A cat wearing a sailor's hat is standing with two hind legs on the driver's seat and two paws on the helm. It blinks, staring at {0.SimFirstName} blankly. \n\nOutside, {0.SimFirstName} hears the propeller start and the boat begins to back away from the dock. Tearing {1.SimFirstName} away from the absurd scene, they both get off the boat. It sails away, cruising into the horizon."--></T>

It is a tiny blue and white skipper with "Old Lady Sea" written in black across the bow. A tiny door to the cabin is just across the deck, as is a small window.
