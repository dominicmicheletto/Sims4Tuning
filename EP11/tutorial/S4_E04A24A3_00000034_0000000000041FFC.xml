      <T n="text">0x295389BF<!--String: "Foxes roam the world of Henford-on-Bagley. Most often they keep their distance from residences, preferring to roam in secluded areas. In particular, they're commonly found near their fox den, located in the shade of the great tree at the Volpe Island ruins in the Bramblewood. However, if left unchecked, foxes can pose a threat to your garden, your chickens, your eggs, and any rabbits that are around. While a locked door poses no challenge to a sly fox, there are other ways to deal with them..."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x8365DB11<!--String: "A friendly way to neutralize any danger from the local fox population is simply by befriending them. Foxes love receiving gifts, but they're also generally happy just to socialize with any Sim who shows interest in spending time with them. They can be a bit mischievous at first, but they'll come around as you gain their trust. Once you're friends with a fox, you can approach them and "Ask Not to Steal". From that point on, as long as you maintain a friendly relationship with them, they'll willingly leave your garden and your critters alone."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x650D2CC8<!--String: "Foxes can be dealt with in other more direct ways though. Should a fox visit your lot with bad intentions, you can approach them and Shoo them away. If you're feeling proactive about protecting your Chicken Coop, Sims with the Handiness Skill can upgrade it with the "Fox Be-Gone Alarm".\n\nAnimals can also help ward off foxes. Roosters are natural foes to foxes; they'll aggressively pursue any fox in their proximity that approaches the Chicken Coop. Llamas are also fearless fox defenders. Llamas will spit at any fox in the nearby vicinity to scare them away. "--></T>

The "Wild Foxes" Lot Challenge can be applied to, or removed from, any lot within Build Mode. Lots that have this challenge applied (all lots in Henford-on-Bagley have this challenge by default), will have foxes occasionally visit the lot to steal from your garden, or attack your animals. You can also enable the Wild Foxes Lot Challenge in other worlds, so as to experience foxes in any location."--></T>
