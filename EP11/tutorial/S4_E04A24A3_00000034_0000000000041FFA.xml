Up to three eggs can incubate in one coop and Hens returning to the coop will try to nest on them. These eggs eventually hatch no matter what, but they having a nesting Hen will help them hatch sooner and produce a happier Chick.\n\nWatch for a notification when an egg is close to hatching. Sims can help the Chick hatch and enjoy the magical moment of new life entering the world."--></T>
