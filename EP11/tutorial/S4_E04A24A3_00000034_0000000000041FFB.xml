      <T n="text">0xF5E9CF79<!--String: "Rabbits are curious little critters who can be found hopping around in both Old New Henford and The Bramblewood. Should you live in those neighborhoods, don't be surprised to find cute bunnies burrowing their way into your yard to pay a visit. If you're looking for a rabbit in the wild though, try locating the stumps of cut down trees  that they call home near the banks of the River Bagley. When traveling within Henford-on-Bagley, you'll even find these tree stumps dotted on the map, to help you locate them within the world."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xE91E9CC3<!--String: "Once you've located a Wild Rabbit, you can approach it and begin interacting with it. You can start slowly - choosing to observe them from a distance, or if you're feeling bold you may approach them and interact with them directly. See the Gifts for Wild Animals lesson for tips on how to quickly build a friendship with the various rabbits you'll encounter in Henford-on-Bagley!"--></T>

      <T n="text">0x24E58533<!--String: "Building a friendship with a rabbit has its advantages. Not only are they fun for Sims of nearly every age, but rabbits are wonderful at helping tend to nearby gardens. If you live in Old New Henford or The Bramblewood, you can ask rabbits living in the neighborhood to help with gardening, and you'll find they'll nibble on any weeds that pop up to allow your plants to grow healthy and strong! In addition, rabbits find Garden Patches to be tantalizing toilets... Their little pellets of poop will naturally fertilize the Oversized Crops in your garden, helping them to grow nice and large!"--></T>

Once you're friends with any Wild Rabbit, you can purchase a rabbit home for your own home with all of the gardening benefits they can bestow.

I repeat, <b>DO NOT</b> get on a rabbit's bad side. The consequences can be disastrous. You've been warned...\n\n<i>Psst...</i> Locking your doors won't save you.
