Having a “Henford Heart-to-Heart” conversation with them might reveal what they would like. Then again, they might say something else unexpected, especially if they really like the Sim! While chatting with them, see if they could use a hand with anything with “Offer to Help with Errands…”. They are sure to reward helpful Sims."--></T>
