If you prefer a more "home grown" approach, place an Animal Shed and a Chicken Coop from Build Mode. This will enable you to purchase your very own Cows, Llamas, Roosters, and Hens. You even can raise baby Chicks!\n\nYou can also purchase a new Garden Patch from Build Mode and plant Oversized Crops such as pumpkins, watermelon, and even aubergine if you are looking for a sustainable meat substitute in cooking."--></T>
