      <T n="text">0x94C5953<!--String: "Sims can try milking their Cows in early morning and around midday. Milking doesn't require any skill, but sometimes Cows have other ideas. Success is more likely when the Sim is in a good mood and the Cow's needs are met. Cows always produce regular Milk and provide additional special types of milk when fed certain Animal Treats. (See "Animal Treats" for more on producing special Milks.)\n\nMilk can be consumed directly (lactose-intolerant Sims beware!), sold, and used in recipes. Special Milks confer various benefits. Check the Notebook to learn more."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xE63C05AC<!--String: "Once per day, starting early morning, Sims can trying shearing their Llamas and collect the Llama Wool. Shearing doesn't require any skill, but Llamas are not famous for being nice. Increase chance of success by ensuring the Sim is in a good mood, and that the Llama's needs are all taken care of. Shearing produces Llama Wool that matches the Llama's current color, and will turn the Llama back to its natural color. (See "Animal Treats" for notes on changing Llama color.)\n\nLlama Wool can be sold, but has other uses, too. Use Llama Wool to reduce the cost of Cross-stitching or Knitting, or as a required ingredient in Animal Clothing. (The Creature Keeper can help!)\n\nShearing is optional: Sims cannot shear too much at a time, and unsheared Llamas don't experience any negative effects. (See "Animal Care" for notes on what is required care for animals.)"--></T>
