When all their needs are fulfilled, they become Happy!\n\nHover over an animal to see its Happiness level, status of needs, and other information such as life stage."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x2555754C<!--String: "Having happy animals is more than a reason to be proud: happier animals produce higher quality ingredients and respond more positively when Sims interact with them! The opposite holds true for Unhappy animals.\n\nAnimals that stay Happy long enough will become Very Happy. If any of the animal's needs fall too low, it will need time to become Very Happy once again. Don't worry if this happens! Keep caring for your animals and they'll be Very Happy before you know it."--></T>

The animals will eat on their own when food is available there. Sims also can feed them by hand. Don't worry about overfeeding - they'll never get too full."--></T>

Sims can't clean chickens directly. Chickens preen themselves clean whenever they need to and are able. Sims can help keep their chickens clean by keeping the Chicken Coop clean.\n\n<b>Cows and Llamas</b>: Just like Coops, Animal Sheds and their occupants get dirty over time. Sims can brush Cows and Llamas to clean them and have a nice moment together. Sims should clean out Animal Sheds every day or two."--></T>

The chance of that going well is better when the Sim is in a good mood and the animal is Happy. Nearby animals gain some Attention, too, when those actions go well.\n\nIf socializing is not going well, hover over the animal to check for unmet needs that might be making the animal grouchy. (But if the animal hates a Sim that has been mean to them repeatedly, don't come crying to us.)"--></T>
