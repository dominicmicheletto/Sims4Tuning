      <T n="text">0xFB3B870A<!--String: "Feeding certain treats to animals can have special results. \n\nSome treats change the color of a Llama's Wool. Shearing the Llama restores their original color.\n\nSome treats enable Chickens to lay different types of Eggs. Some can be used in recipes and some may even hatch special Chickens.\n\nSome treats result in different types of milk from Cows. These can be used in certain recipes and some have particular short-term effects on the Sims who drink them. That Fire Milk is spicy!\n\nLastly, some treats have the same effect on Chickens, Cows, and Llamas. For example, the Friendly Treat improves a Sim’s relationship with any of these animals."--></T>
