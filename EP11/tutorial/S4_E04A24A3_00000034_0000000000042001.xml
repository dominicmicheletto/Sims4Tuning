      <T n="text">0xB9ED8372<!--String: "Certain villagers living in Henford-on-Bagley have errands that they'd appreciate your help with. These are Sims that have special roles within the village, such as the Mayor, the Pub Owner, and many others. The best way to get acquainted with these Sims is by visiting the Information Board in Finchwick's square. There, you'll find the names of these villagers, their roles, and what they look like."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xA307FA77<!--String: "Once you've located one of these special villagers, you can interact with them and "Offer Help With Errands". They'll be happy to let you know various tasks that they currently need assistance with. You can select up to three errands to work on simultaneously, and there's no time limit to complete them. Different errands from different villagers will provide different rewards, so be sure to meet everyone in the town to see what they're offering."--></T>

As tasks are completed, new tasks may appear. Once all tasks are checked off, you'll receive your rewards!
