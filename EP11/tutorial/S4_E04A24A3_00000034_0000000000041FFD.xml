      <T n="text">0xE563C7<!--String: "Once you've located a Flock of Wild Birds, you can approach their home and begin interacting with them. You can start slowly - choosing to observe them from a distance, or if you're feeling bold you may approach them and interact with them directly. Should they enjoy your banter, you'll find yourself building a friendship with the entire flock that calls the tree trunk their home."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x709EC34D<!--String: "Building a friendship with a Flock of Wild Birds has its advantages. Not only will you have a flock of feathered friends, but birds are quite adept at assisting with nearby gardens. Should you call Old New Henford or The Bramblewood your Sims' home, you can ask the local flock to help with gardening, and you'll find they'll keep your garden free of pesky insects. They'll also sing their lilting bird song to your Oversized Crops, helping them grow faster and even larger!"--></T>

Once you're friends with one of the flocks, you can purchase a bird home for your own home along with all of the gardening benefits they can bestow. Find it in the Build Mode catalog by searching for "Flock of Wild Birds". Soon you will have birds flitting to-and-fro outside your windows!"--></T>
