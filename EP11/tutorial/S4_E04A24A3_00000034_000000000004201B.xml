Cooking food and then giving it to a wild animal is one of the easiest types, but there are many more options. When attempting to "Give Gift", you'll see a variety of gifts Sims can offer to gain their trust."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xFBEF137C<!--String: "Each wild animal has their own preferences for gifts they dislike, like, and love. Sometimes Sims can try "Discover Gift Preferences" and the animal will share how they feel about a type of gift. More often, though, Sims need to offer a gift and note how the animal reacts. As Sims learn which types the animal likes, the question mark next to each type of gift becomes a thumbs up, thumbs down, or a heart so Sims know which to continue giving and which to avoid."--></T>

When you see these animals thinking about a gift box, you'll know they have a gift they want to share. Select "Take Gift" from the animal. As the Sim's relationship with an animal improves, the gifts will only get better!"--></T>
