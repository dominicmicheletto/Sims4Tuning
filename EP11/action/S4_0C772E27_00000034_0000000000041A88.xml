No, not some sort of hybridized llama-chicken creature, but rather his llama that he had affectionately named Chicken! What a winner she was! Chicken was a very intelligent and friendly llama and Sims came from all around Henford-on-Bagley to meet her! It's no wonder that the fair became a regular tradition afterwards."--></T>

He bestowed a particularly splendid bovine topiary to Princess Cordelia upon her visit. We keep his memory alive today by decorating the town with them for each fair."--></T>
