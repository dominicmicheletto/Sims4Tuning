                  <T>0x9372C770<!--String: "It's rumored young nobles on secret holiday used to abscond to the cottage at the top of Cordelia Falls in the Bramblewood. Oh, to have seen what they did when they thought no one was watching!"--></T>
                  <T>0xB0CF840F<!--String: "The ruins on the hill outside of Finchwick used to be a lord's manor - a grand house that looked over all of Henford-on-Bagley. If you look closely, you can still see them all the way from Old New Henford."--></T>
                  <T>0x699C93D0<!--String: "The Watson family used to own the entirety of the Old New Henford area, but over hundreds of years, they've been selling off plots one by one. I wouldn't be surprised if the half the headstones in the Finchwick cemetery were Watsons."--></T>
                  <T>0x9A6EC6AB<!--String: "A few years back, someone renovated a historic barn in the Old New Henford area. I love seeing history preserved in special ways like that, a reminder that we don't have to leave our pasts behind to move forward."--></T>
                  <T>0x1807D90<!--String: "Some people say Lord Volpe, the founder of Finchwick, had a pet fox, while others insist that he had a pet snail. There are no definitive records either way, but I like to think that Sophie the Snail is proof positive that he was a snail man. Why else would there be a snail maze in the Bramblewood?"--></T>
                  <T>0x6D164E4B<!--String: "Well, if you're looking for the best place to fish in the Henford-on-Bagley area, you'll want to stop by Old New Henford and visit the pond at the base of Olde Mill Hill. I once knew a Sim who claims to have caught a wolf eel there!"--></T>
                  <T>0x21C5D535<!--String: "Before the bridge-building frenzy a few hundred years back - you'd think the village was called Bridgertown or something - you'd have to swim if you wanted to cross the River Bagley. Sims would always have their swimming clothes handy when doing errands around town!"--></T>
                  <T>0x2F6E3E7E<!--String: "The well in the center of Finchwick used to be filled with water, but a certain elderly local hit someone so hard with her purse that they almost fell in! After that, the mayor had it drained and filled with flowers."--></T>
                  <T>0x89881A91<!--String: "Did you know that the sunny flowers hanging in the lampposts around town all come from local gardens? Those in Finchwick are tended by any Sim with a spare moment, while others come from the homes of Henford-on-Bagley residents. In a way, their brightness is a reflection of the light we all shine on each other."--></T>
                  <T>0xFBCCA4BA<!--String: "One of the most romantic places in the Henford-on-Bagley area are the old Isle of Volpe ruins in the Bramblewood. Getting a kiss from your love when wrapped in their arms - why, it's like a scene from a movie. Don't we all want our happily ever after?"--></T>
                  <T>0x7214BF9F<!--String: "Finchwick was so named due to all the greenfinches in the area. Lord Volpe loved the way they sang to each other. We also have robins, great tits, willow tits, goldcrests, and blackcaps for any Sim looking to do a bit of birding."--></T>
                  <T>0xEEBDE3DD<!--String: "Simply because Old New Henford has been around for a while doesn't mean things don't change. Take the community garden, for example. An enterprising neighbor started it a few years back and the entire community has ensured that it's really taken off."--></T>
                  <T>0x29E212ED<!--String: "Finchwick was beset by pirates once! Princess Cordelia was visiting and it's rumored that she brought those scallywags as company. Then again, perhaps beset isn't quite the term to us, as they were all very polite while they were here. In fact, they're the ones who started the whole Finchwick Favor tradition!"--></T>
                  <T>0xF4B8A020<!--String: "Even though Finchwick has grown from the days when it was nothing more than a cemetery and an aubergine seller, it still feels like the sort of place where we're all willing to help each other out."--></T>
                  <T>0x5AF94BB5<!--String: "Even though property values in the Bramblewood have risen quite steadily over the past few years, some who've lived in Henford-on-Bagley for quite some time have sworn they won't sell to those looking to turn the woods into the next hot vacation destination, or whatever it is they put on their brochures."--></T>
