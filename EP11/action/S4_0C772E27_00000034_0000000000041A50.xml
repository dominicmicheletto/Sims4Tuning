Roses are known to help budding relationships blossom, and I've entrusted you with two of them. Offer them to two single Sims who would make the perfect pair, and see if they fall for each other.\n\nI also need your help selling some extra inventory Agnes and I have at our Garden Shop. It's simple really... You'll buy my overstocked seeds at an extraordinarily fair price, and then you'll speak to a number of other Sims about this exciting opportunity to sell surplus seeds. Get enough Sims on board, and we'll all be rolling in the green!"--></T>
