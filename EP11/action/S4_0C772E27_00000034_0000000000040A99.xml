But on this day, she never came home and nobody ever saw her ever again. Some say she ran away, but others swear that if you look out over Olde Mill Lane in the early morning, you can see a bicycle with two flower baskets - one in the front and one in the back - riding itself along the dirt path, heading back up Olde Mill Hill, bringing the little Watson girl home."--></T>

Well, his first wife was Lady Volpe, a beauty who many thought a witch from the Bramblewood. Some say she spoke with foxes, others that she controlled the snails. What we know for certain is that she drowned in the River Bagley. If you go swimming in it nowadays without leaving a present for Sophie, she might pull you down. So best leave a little gift under Sophie the Snail lest you feel a tickle on your feet in the river, I say."--></T>

Many years ago, there was an accident - that poor Algernon Watson - and they shut it down to make sure everything was safe before letting anyone back in. But the strangest thing! That very night, the mill started turning again, all on its own. They went by the next morning and the door was locked from the inside! They've never shut the mill down since. I'd reckon they're afraid to now."--></T>
