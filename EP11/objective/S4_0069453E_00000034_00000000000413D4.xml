Find them, and give them the rose that the Grocery Owner asked you to send along.\n\nShould you happen to lose the rose the Grocery Owner provided and find yourself in need of another one, they're occasionally sold at the Garden Shop in Finchwick's square. Alternatively, there's always the old fashioned approach of simply growing a rose bush of your own at home."--></T>
