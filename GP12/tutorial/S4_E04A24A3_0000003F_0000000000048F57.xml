      <T n="text">0x1C053966<!--String: "Sims who get into a fight with Werewolves are at risk for contracting Werebies. They may also get it while exploring the secret underground tunnels. This infection will eventually progress into full blown lycanthropy. \n\nRumor has it, the bartender at Grimtooth knows of a remedy if your Sim is not quite ready for this life change! There are also <i>less conventional</i> ways to try to get rid of it, like trying to sweat it out as well as a few other things to try. Be warned though, the window to do this is limited. "--></T>

Otherwise, they need to be on friendly terms. The biting Werewolf must also have the Cursed Bite Ability available to them."--></T>

Only Werewolves within your household may bite Sims without being asked. "--></T>
