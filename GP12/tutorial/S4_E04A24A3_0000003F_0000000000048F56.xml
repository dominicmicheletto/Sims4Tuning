      <T n="text">0x66FA370F<!--String: "Fury is the driving force behind Werewolves. More and more beastly behaviors come out as the orb fills. \n\nUnlike other Sim needs, Fury is constantly ticking up with few ways to lower it. Sims gain extra Fury based on their likes, dislikes, and the Temperaments they gain as they grow. Abilities and Fighting will also increase this, so use them wisely! The Moon phases have a variety of effects, and on a Full Moon the call of the beast is too much to resist.  "--></T>
