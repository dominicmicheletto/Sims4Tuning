      <T n="text">0x86B7AA3B<!--String: "Welcome to San Myshuno! This city is made up of four distinct districts: the Spice Market, the Fashion District, The Arts Quarter and Uptown.\n\nIn addition, Myshuno Meadows is a large city park tucked beneath the skyscrapers if your Sims need to get away for a touch of nature.\n\nDepending on where your Sims choose to live, you’ll get a very different flavor of the city. You might find yourself in a cramped, roach-infested studio apartment in the Arts Quarter…  Or you might be enjoying a breathtaking view of the city from your very own tricked-out rooftop penthouse Jacuzzi in Uptown."--></T>
