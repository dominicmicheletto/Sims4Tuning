This allows you to have a more active role in gaining your Sim career points without sending them away. It also brings your Sims opportunities to get out and explore all the new experiences San Myshuno has to offer.\n"--></T>

      <T n="text">0x5E00528D<!--String: "You can choose to Work From Home in a number of ways. About an hour before work starts, a small alarm will go off above your Sim’s skewer. Select that Sim to see your options to either Go To Work, Work From Home, or Take the Day Off. If you happen to miss the alarm notification or just want to plan out your day in advance, the option to Work From Home can also be found in your Phone Menu. If your Sim has already gone to work onsite, you’ll need to wait until the next work day if you want them to Work From Home."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xCE4446FA<!--String: "If you choose to Work From Home, you’ll immediately get two randomized tasks for the day in your Career Panel. Now here’s the beauty: you can do those tasks at your leisure! Successfully completing the tasks before your next work day will give you points toward your career progress and you’ll get paid out at the end of the day. The best thing about Working From Home is that it gives your Sim a reason to get out of their apartment and go explore the different Festivals, different locations, and different people of the city that you may not have otherwise known exist!"--></T>
