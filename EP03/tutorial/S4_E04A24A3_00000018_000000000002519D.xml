Sims not only will enjoy bonding and creating long lasting relationships with their neighbors or even gain some enemies. Neighbors with different traits will add an element of surprise and community to your shared space. Flirty Sims may come over for a shower… and loner Sims you may just never see them! Meet a new BFF? You can now give them a key to your place so they can come and hang out whenever they are free! Change your mind? You can totally ask for it back. The stories and relationships will have endless possibilities. "--></T>

Being around problems can make Sims miserable. Sims can use their Handiness Skill to fix them, but if they aren't handy enough, they can ask the Landlord to help. Better make your Sims have a friendly relationship and pay their rent on time! Apartment's problems are built into the apartment and cannot be removed in Build Mode. "--></T>

Elevators are the most important since you can use it to go downstairs and travel. When out in the neighborhood you can click on your apartment to go back upstairs or visit a friend too.\n\nIf you want to live life unrestricted and build with more freedom, try a penthouse!"--></T>
