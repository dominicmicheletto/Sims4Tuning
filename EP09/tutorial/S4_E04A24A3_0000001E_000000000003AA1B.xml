These can have a variety of effects, ranging from how much Sims in the area are paid for their jobs, to how NPCs behave, to even the neighborhood’s Eco Footprint!\n\nIt’s possible for up to four Neighborhood Action Plans to be active at one time in any residential neighborhood."--></T>

Voting re-opens and closes on the same days each week.
