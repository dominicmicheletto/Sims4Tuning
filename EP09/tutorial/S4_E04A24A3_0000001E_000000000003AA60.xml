      <T n="text">0x2F40FAC4<!--String: "Crafting new objects in Eco Lifestyle allows you to take old things and make them new again. The first step is to use a Recycler to recycle anything you have in your Sim's Inventory or the Household Inventory. Then, take the Bits and Pieces you've obtained from the Recycler, and create new items using the Fabricator. Diving in a Dumpster is a great way to find things you can use in the Recycler!"--></T>

      <T n="text">0x11288C16<!--String: "When you use the Recycler, you will obtain a new currency called Bits and Pieces. Bits and Pieces are needed to make things in the Fabricator. You can always hover over the Household Funds or the Recycler to see how many Bits and Pieces you have."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xE7A6996C<!--String: "Click on the Fabricator to begin crafting an item. The picker will give you the choice of what item and what color. To create different colored items, you need to use dyes. Dyes can be purchased, gifted, or found while interacting with other Eco Lifestyle items.\n\nThe Fabrication Skill can be increased by making objects at the Fabricator or Candle Making Table. Leveling up will unlock more recipes for your Sim to create. These items can be made using the Bits and Pieces you receive from the Recycler."--></T>

      <T n="text">0xB41B2CFE<!--String: "You can also make fizzy juice using the Juice Fizzer. The Juice Fizzer does not use Bits and Pieces, but it uses ingredients such as fruit. You'll first need to load the ingredients, and then start the fizzing process. When it's done, you'll retrieve your beverage from the machine. Using more ingredients will create a multi-pack of beverages. It will cost a few more Simoleons, but will be cheaper per bottle to produce."--></T>
